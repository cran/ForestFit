\title{Estimating parameters of the Johnson's SB (JSB) distribution using four methods}
\description{Suppose \eqn{x=(x_1,\dots,x_n)^T} denotes a vector of \eqn{n} independent observations coming from a four-parameter JSB distribution with probability density function given given by
\deqn{
f\bigl(x\big|\Theta\bigr) = \frac {\delta \lambda}{\sqrt{2\pi}(x-\xi)(\lambda+\xi-x)}\exp\Biggl\{-\frac{1}{2}\Bigg[\gamma+\delta\log \biggl(\frac{x-\xi}{\lambda+\xi-x}\biggr) \Bigg]^2\Biggr\},
}
where \eqn{\xi<x<\lambda+\xi}, \eqn{\Theta=(\delta,\gamma,\lambda,\xi)^T} with \eqn{\delta, \lambda> 0}, \eqn{-\infty<\gamma<\infty}, and \eqn{-\infty<\xi<\infty}. Using Bayesian approach, method of conditional maximum likelihood (CML, Johnson (1949)), method of moment (MM, Fonseca(2009)), and two-percentile method that proposed by Knoebel and Burkhart (1991) (KB). We compute all four estimators when the scale \eqn{\lambda}, and location \eqn{\xi}, parameters are predetermined. The method proposed by Ogana (2018) has been used for predetermining the scale and location parameters. Let DBH accounts for diameter at breast height (DBH),  for estimating parameters \eqn{\delta} and \eqn{\gamma} through the Bayesian approach, the location and scale parameters are predetermined as \eqn{\xi = \min(DBH) - 1.34} and \eqn{\lambda = \max(DBH) - \xi + 3.8}, respectively. For the MM, CML, and KB methods, the parameters \eqn{\xi} and \eqn{\lambda} are predetermined in the same way as suggested by Ogana (2018).

\usage{fitJSB(y, n.burn=8000, n.simul=10000)}
\arguments{
  \item{y}{Vector of DBH observations.}
  \item{n.burn}{Length of the burn-in period, i.e., the point after which Gibbs sampler is supposed to attain convergence. By default \code{n.burn} is 8000.}
  \item{n.simul}{Total numbers of Gibbs sampler iterations. By default \code{n.simul} is 10,000.}
}
\details{The Bayes' estimators are obtained by averaging on the all iterations between \code{n.burn} and \code{n.simul}.}
\value{A list of objects in two parts as
\enumerate{
\item Four estimators including Bayes, MM, CML, and KB.
\item A sequence of four goodness-of-fit measures consist of Anderson-Darling (\code{AD}), Cramer-von Mises (\code{CVM}), Kolmogorov-Smirnov (\code{KS}), and log-likelihood (\code{log-likelihood}) statistics.
